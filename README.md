# Text-Analysis
I implemented a comprehensive system for analyzing and predicting the toxicity of text comments using Python and various machine learning approaches, leveraging natural language processing techniques for text data preprocessing and employing both generative and discriminative models. The system efficiently handles data loading, cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization, converting text into numerical sequences with consistent length using the pad_sequences function. For the generative model, I developed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an LSTM layer to learn sequential dependencies in text data, trained it using the fit method with class balancing via SMOTE oversampling, and evaluated it on the test set, printing metrics like loss and accuracy, and saving the model with pickle for future use. For the discriminative model, I created a pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization, SMOTE, and an SVM classifier, training and evaluating it using the fit method and performance metrics including accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. The system also featured a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction, Google Drive integration for sharing model files, and customizable options to fine-tune model performance.
